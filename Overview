Fruit Catcher:

The general idea is quite similar to ApplePicker prototype, with a tree dropping a certain type of fruit while moving left and right.
But instead of doing a basket that is controlled (left-right) by mouse movement, we are planning to create a basket launcher in which the basket will be thrown into the air to catch the fruit mid-air. Once the basket lands back on ground, the basket will be destroyed after 1 second. 

The player goal is to catch 10 fruits per level, there will be certain number of level in which each level either the Tree is moving faster or has a higher drop rate.

Scoring: 
If the player unable to catch the Orange once it reach the ground, the score of orange caught reduced by 2 (or turn back to 0 if the caught orange was 2 or below.
